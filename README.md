What I built :

 - built the header like youtube
 - built the side bar same as youtube
 - created menu slice to expand and collapse the side bar using redux
 - used youtube video apis to get the home page videos
 - displayed the videos
 - created some helper functions to truncate / get the decoded view counts for the videos
 - created some configs to display side bar items and filter buttons
